              Everyone has those “crossroads moments” in life, when a new path
              must be chosen. After many years in science education, I arrived
              in that moment with a lot of experience: teaching, proofreading
              and copyediting, and fiber artistry, all while being a mother and
              grandmother, with all of the organizational skill set that
              requires. Web development was the obvious choice to use it all:
              markup and editing, design, language, and problem-solving.
            </p>

              I enjoy the detail and the creative problem-solving of coding. It
              is so satisfying to take a website idea and making it all work --
              and look fabulous! I know that ease of collaboration,
              trouble-shooting, and updating are important to my clients, and I
              approach every project with this foundation of correct, concise,
              and elegant code in mind.
