                    <p>Everyone has those “crossroads moments” in life,  when a new path must be chosen.  After many years in science education, I arrived in that moment with a lot of experience:  teaching, proofreading and copyediting, and fiber artistry, all while being  a mother and grandmother, with all of the organizational skill set that requires. Web development was the obvious choice to use it all: markup and editing, design, language, and problem-solving. </p>

                    <p>I enjoy the detail and the creative problem-solving of coding. It is so satisfying to take a website idea and making it all work -- and look fabulous!  I know that ease of collaboration, trouble-shooting, and updating are important to my clients, and I approach every project with this foundation of correct, concise, and elegant code in mind.</p>
